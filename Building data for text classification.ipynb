       "\"I had never heard of Chun Li until I first saw the announcement that Kristin Kreuk would get the lead. What I eventually learned about The Street Fighter, I liked. A female lead in an action role which could compare somewhat to Batman sounded enticing. I guess another comparison that crossed my mind was Lara Croft.Kristin Kreuk won a great part when she got the role of Chun Li. Being a fair-weather fan of Smallville, I had long hoped she would find a fitting character in the movies. Her time has come. I like her ability to show intensity and weakness. Emotion is her best partner in acting.As far as the movie itself goes, I felt somewhat cheated. I was intrigued by the introduction which was narrated nicely by Kristin. Some of the narration that continued was OK, but it soon became an awkward and overbearing distraction. The director obviously did not recognize that crossing the line by over-narration in an action movie could be a definite drawback. He also did not seem to know that, while this is a movie about a fictitious crime/street fighter, you don't have to litter this kind of movie with weak and poorly played characters like Charlie Nash and Detective Maya Sunee. They both seemed to be square pegs being forced into round holes. Chris Klein overplayed his part as though he thought playing an immature detective meant acting like a 12 year old one moment and 17 otherwise. I am sure the 12 and 17 year-olds who played this game were just as disappointed as I was with his portrayal. Meanwhile, Moon Bloodgood seemed to be just as unsure what she was doing with her character. If there is a sequel, these two characters will have to be re-hashed - hopefully by two different actors. And at this point, I have to say, a new director should be considered as well. Andrzej Bartkowiak seemed too loosely connected to the true potential of this movie. Forget about accentuating bumbling law enforcement, focus more on action, mystery and oriental intrigue. Comic relief is good but outright stupidity is unforgivable.I found the fight scenes fun to watch and special effects were enjoyable although minimal. The story was good ; better than the story tellers.Michael Clarke Duncan and Neal McDonough both were great. The deadly threat they both portrayed helped to keep the story together by giving the good guys more evil to fight off than they seemed to be able to handle. And Robin Shou was a great trainer and partner for Kistin Kreuk. If Kristin and Robin come back for a sequel, then the sequel stands a chance of being better than the original, even though, I still give Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li a 7/10\""

       "'I admired the film more than I enjoyed it, but it kept my interest throughout despite being a bit of slog at times. It\\'s fascinating. The title \\'Capone\\' invokes the expectation that this was a biopic of the famous gangster, but this isn\\'t that at all. This is something very different, and very deliberately so, but due to the title it\\'s going to confuse and disappoint most people (which is why Trank hated that he had to change it from the original title \\'Fonzo\\' for marketing reasons). There\\'s hardly a reference for this kind of film; it\\'s not a traditional narrative in any sense.What I keep thinking about is how even most gangster films who pretend to de-glamorize criminals and their lifestyle fail; it\\'s the same problem with the \"anti-\" war movie that still depicts a rousing, exciting adventure next to the misery and the atrocities and thus defeats its own purpose. Rare is the war or gangster film that actually achieves to show the underlying emptiness; the ugly, banal, vulgar and sad reality that ultimately is what most lives of violence lead towards until the haunting memories are the only thing that remains.The reason for that is obvious: nobody would watch that kind of film because it would be too bleak. But \\'Capone\\' manages that rare feat: it\\'s bleak - but not bleak enough to turn you off, and it\\'s even often entertaining (in terms of its performances, the fantastic score, the beautiful cinematography). But even though this probably wasn\\'t the film\\'s intention, it still manages to be the ultimate deconstruction of the gangster as an \"icon\" - more so even than Scorsese\\'s \\'Irishman\\' (though it\\'s nowhere near as good a film).I liked Capone; it\\'s weird (and I guess you shouldn\\'t watch it unless you like profoundly weird little arthouse films) but this is definitely not a badly made film. I hope Trank continues on this path and makes more strange, personal films - although perhaps of the kind that are a little more accessible.'"

Its just weird and doesnt really have any dramatic arc or raising the tension. Basically the whole movie is a few strangers saying WTF? constantly and everyone else telling them \" \\'ts ok ! guys\"\\nAlso besides that, its revolves around a traumatized, annoying and totally without self respect girl that slowly starts benefiting from this weird place. Because of course, we cannot have a film these days without it being a \"personal journey\" of some sorts. Writers trying to be smart and \"deep\".\\nYeah nothing beats a bizzare and crazy rituals to make you sane.If youre expecting horror and monsters or supernatural, keep going. Its just a weird film with no real ending, resolution, interesting character or events. Albeit with nice filmography and quite good actors it has no real dramatic structure or captivating story.'"
